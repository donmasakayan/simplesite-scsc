          <p>
            SCSC Philippines initially came about to bring awareness to individual customers and organizations in the Philippines, sharing the impact washrooms can have on the health of users. We wanted to help in our own little way to create a clean, refreshing, and germ-free living environment… and we thought of starting in the washroom, which is almost always ignored in the house and business units.
          </p>
          <p>
            We at SCSC Philippines started to commit ourselves to provide quality products and services aimed to answer common washroom hygiene concerns in both private and public areas. Providing optimum washroom solutions help our clients meet and exceed their needs for a cleaner, safer, and more comfortable washroom.

        <h3 class="text-secondary">How We Started</h3>
        <p>
          Sheila Bagus, the owner and founder of SCSC Philippines, was initially affiliated with an international company pioneering in pest control, hygiene and workwear services.
        </p>
        <p>
          This gave Ms. Bagus to come up with the same business model, but provide better solutions and products of higher quality and that are environmental-friendly. 7 years along her affiliation with the international company, she became an incorporator of another business of similar line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, 10 years after, in 2004, she founded SCSC Philippines, focusing on providing superior washroom hygiene solutions using enhanced product line that are not only safe for the human body, but friendly to the environment, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her vast and extensive years of experience dealing with hygiene products, client concerns, and washroom services have helped her developed the perfect solutions for various washroom hygiene problems at home and in business establishments -- and it was called SCSC Philippines.

        <p>
          Heavy-traffic washrooms experience very high foot fall, which leads to heavy soiling and persistent high usage of products and fixtures. Washroom facilities at schools, malls, airports, restaurants, and recreation facilities like cinemas are some examples of places with high-traffic washrooms. We have products and services to match the challenges of high-traffic washrooms which ensure constant hygiene and operational standards.
